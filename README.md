None

- Once the recording has been complete:
  - The waveform should be shown for the audio
  - A Save Audio Buttion should be presented
    - on Click, the audio should be save to the Vue State
    - capture the entire sessionâ€™s audio file and send it separately to your back-end service to be saved to the database. (currently just stub out this functionality)
  - A Delete Audio Button should be presented
    - on Click, the audio should be deleted from the local state
- While Recording
  - The recording framework needs to be able to have an event that is fired every 5 seconds to capture the audio byte stream in chunks while recording, rather than at the end of the recording session.
  -  Each chunk of byte audio stream data needs to be sent to a Node js back-end(rest or graphql api) as .wav format. (back-end javascript framework of your choice) (currently simply create a function which handles the submitting of it with correct error handling, backend functionality will be implemented late)
